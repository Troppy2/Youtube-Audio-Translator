# Youtube-Audio-Translator
While watching YouTube videos, I noticed that language barriers can make it difficult to access useful content. If you don’t understand the language being spoken, you’re unlikely to keep watching — and instead of finding the answer you were looking for, you might end up going down a rabbit hole searching for alternatives.

This project was my attempt to solve that problem by creating a website that translates the audio in YouTube videos. Although I wasn’t able to complete it due to my limited experience with backend development and JavaScript, the idea remains something I’m passionate about improving in the future.
